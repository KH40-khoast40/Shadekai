## Usage
Apply Object.fx to the materials. (clone the fx file if you want to use the shader on 2 or more materials with different settings).

Make sure to input the neccessary texture names in the fx.

## Notices
- Make sure that your Project Sekai model has vertex color that looks like this in the UV2 slot.

- Turn off the model's edge line in PMXE, the shader will create it itself. They will clash if they exist simultaneously.
- Normally, the rim light will be visible from the start. But once you load **Shadekai_Controller.pmx**, it will disappear due to the color is reset to 0. You have to turn the color sliders up for it to appear again.
- The texture that ends with "_H" is necessary for the shader to color the skin. However, it is extremely low-res and can cause some disconnections between parts. You should upscale it using Waifu2x.
- The shader can't make parts glow based on map, because that job is for a post-processing effect.


## Rules
‚úîÔ∏è **Modification is allowed, you can customize the shader, or add new features to it all you want.**

‚úîÔ∏è **Including the shader with the models you distribute is allowed.**

‚ùå **Commercial use is not allowed**, please use other shaders that allow this.

‚ùå **Redistributing the shader (putting the intact shader as the main focus of the DL) is not allowed**, you can link this page for the viewers to download it directly.

‚úîÔ∏è **However, it's fine for you to put your modification of the shader for DL.**

‚ö†Ô∏è The shader itself is not limited to any kind of contents. **The usage limit completely depends on the model you are going to apply the shader to.**

‚ö†Ô∏è **I am not responsible for any damages that are caused by the use of the shader**, please consider carefully when you use the shader.

üóø **Once again, please credit me, or mention the shader's name when you use it, thank you**
