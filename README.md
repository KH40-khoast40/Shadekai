# Shadekai
A MMD shader that is utilized in making ripped Project Sekai models look as identical as how they are in-game as possible.

## Features
- Skin tone variation based on characters
- Accurate shadow color (no self-made toons involved)
- Directional rim lighting
- Edge line & Rim thickness variation based on vertex color
- Automatically colored edge line based on texture

## Usage
Apply Object.fx to the materials. (clone the fx file if you want to use the shader on 2 or more materials with different settings)

Make sure to input the neccessary texture names in the fx

## Rules
✔️ **Modification is allowed, you can customize the shader, or add new features to it all you want.**

✔️ **Including the shader with the models you distribute is allowed.**

❌ **Commercial use is not allowed**, please use other shaders that allow this.

❌ **Redistributing the shader (putting the intact shader as the main focus of the DL) is not allowed**, you can link this page or my dA post of the shader for the viewers to download it directly.

✔️ **However, it's fine for you to put your modification of the shader for DL.**

⚠️ The shader itself is not limited to any kind of contents. **The usage limit completely depends on the model you are going to apply the shader to.**

⚠️ **I am not responsible for any damages that are caused by the use of the shader**, please consider carefully when you use the shader.

🗿 **Once again, please credit me, or mention the shader's name when you use it, thank you**
