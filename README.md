# Shadekai
A MMD shader that is utilized in making ripped Project Sekai models look as identical as how they are in-game as possible.

## Features
- Skin tone variation based on characters
- Accurate shadow color (no self-made toons involved)
- Directional rim lighting
- Edge line & Rim thickness variation based on vertex color
- Automatically colored edge line based on texture

## Usage
Apply Object.fx to the materials. (clone the fx file if you want to use the shader on 2 or more materials with different settings)

Make sure to input the neccessary texture names in the fx

## Notices
- Make sure that your Project Sekai model has vertex color that looks like this in the UV2 slot.
- Normally, the rim light will be visible from the start. But once you load **Shadekai_Controller.pmx**, it will disappear due to the color is reset to 0. You have to turn the color sliders up for it to appear again.
- The texture that ends with "_H" is necessary for the shader to color the skin. However, it is extremely low-res and can cause some disconnections between parts. You should upscale it using Waifu2x


## Rules
‚úîÔ∏è **Modification is allowed, you can customize the shader, or add new features to it all you want.**

‚úîÔ∏è **Including the shader with the models you distribute is allowed.**

‚ùå **Commercial use is not allowed**, please use other shaders that allow this.

‚úîÔ∏è **However, it's fine for you to put your modification of the shader for DL.**

‚ö†Ô∏è The shader itself is not limited to any kind of contents. **The usage limit completely depends on the model you are going to apply the shader to.**
